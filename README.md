# image-train-test-split
Many image data sets for machine learning need splitting into training and testing directories. That is what this tiny script does.

For example if Image is the parent directory, then the structure is as below (just an example)

|- images/
			|- test /
				|- car/
				|- ship/
        |- object-whatever/

			|- train /
				|- car/
				|- ship/
        |- object-whatever/
